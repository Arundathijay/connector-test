# Assignment

Today we are mapping a rocket to a unified model. In this project you'll find a `./unify/Rocket.json` file that represents how the rocket data should be returned.

It's your job to figure out how you can make a call to the SpaceX API by using the OpenApi spec and map the needed fields. The service spec should be added inside the folder `/services/spaceX`.

Also make sure the company property is always uppercase.

Good luck!
